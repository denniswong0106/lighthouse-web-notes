## Async coding

in Async code, the put aside code will always run
after the initial code is run. 

So all the initial code runs first, then
the async code will run.

so if your main file (the main thread), gets 
blocked by a slow function, the rest of the file won't 
execute, so your async functions won't eval until you hit bottom of the file,
even if your async files are already 'done'.

so eval flow:

-> main code
-----
-> scheduled code
