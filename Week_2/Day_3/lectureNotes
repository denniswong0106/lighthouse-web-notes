## what is the internet?

Using postal service as an anology.

the address = IP adress;

internet - we hear of packets.
what packets is is just data split into smaller chunks

so for example, data is cut into many pieces of packets

the recieving pc will take all the packets and repiece them back together

note that the packets may take different routes to another IP address
